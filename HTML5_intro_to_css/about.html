            <h1>The DeLorean Time Machine</h1>
            <p>One of the most iconic elements of "Back to the Future" is the DeLorean time machine. This sleek,
                stainless-steel sports car, modified by Doc Brown, is not just a vehicle but a symbol of adventure and
                innovation.</p>

            <h2>Design and Features</h2>
            <h3>The DeLorean time machine features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Flux Capacitor: The key component for time travel, as Doc Brown explains, “It’s what makes time
                    travel possible.”</li>
                <li>Mr. Fusion: Located on the back of the car, this device converts household waste into the energy
                    needed for time travel.</li>
                <li>Time Circuits: Controls the date and time of travel, allowing Marty and Doc to navigate different
                    eras.</li>
                <li>Hover Conversion: In the second film, the DeLorean is upgraded to hover for travel in 2015.</li>
            </ul>
