                    <p>In the first installment, teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) accidentally travels back to 1955
                        in a
                        DeLorean time machine invented by the eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Marty must
                        ensure
                        his teenage parents, George and Lorraine McFly, fall in love or risk altering his own existence.
                        With
                        the help of Dr. Brown, Marty navigates the complexities of the past to return to his own time.

                    <p>The sequel picks up immediately after the first film. Marty and Doc Brown travel to 2015 to
                        prevent
                        Martyâ€™s future children from becoming entangled in criminal activities. However, a series of
                        missteps
                        lead them to an alternate 1985 where a tyrannical Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) has taken
                        control.
                        Marty and Doc must correct the timeline and restore their original future.</p>

                    <p>In the trilogy's conclusion, Marty travels back to 1885 to rescue Doc Brown, who is trapped in
                        the Wild
                        West. Marty faces challenges in a time far removed from his own, including confrontations with
