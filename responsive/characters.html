            <p>A teenager from Hill Valley, Marty McFly is the quintessential '80s kid with a passion for skateboarding
                and rock music. With a penchant for adventure and a knack for finding himself in extraordinary
                situations, Marty becomes the unlikely hero when he travels back in time. His quick thinking and brave
                heart make him the linchpin in the quest to set history right and ensure his own existence.</p>

            <h2 class="heading_style">Doc Brown</h2>
            <h3 class="heading_style">Portrayed by: Christopher Lloyd</h3>

            <img src="images/doc_brown.jpg" alt="Doc Brown">

            <p>The eccentric inventor of the DeLorean time machine, Dr. Emmett Brown, or "Doc" Brown, is a brilliant yet
                somewhat scatterbrained scientist. His boundless enthusiasm for science and innovation is matched only
                by his wild hair and unpredictable behavior. Doc's deep friendship with Marty is central to the story,
                as they navigate the complexities of time travel together.</p>
